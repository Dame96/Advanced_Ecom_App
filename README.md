# Advanced_Ecom_App

Hi Team, welcome back to my repo! This is a simple yet advanced e-commerce web application built with React, Redux Toolkit, and React Query, using Firebase and Firestore to fetch product data, manage user orders, and store product information.

The project demonstrates modern React development practices including state management, real-time database integration, dynamic UI updates, and client-side routing.

I learned how to implement efficient state management using Redux Toolkit, and how to handle data fetching and caching more effectively with React Query, particularly when integrating with Firebase services.

Features: 
- Product Listing: View products with title, image, description, price, category, and rating

- Category Filtering: Dynamically filter products by category (via dropdown)

- Shopping Cart:

- Add/remove items

- View total price and quantity

- Cart state persisted using sessionStorage

- Checkout Simulation: Mimics a checkout process

Routing:

Home (/)

Cart (/cart)

Navigation Header: Displays total items in cart
