# Advanced_Ecom_App

Hi Team welcome back to my Repo: This is a simple, yet advanced e-commerce web application built with React, Redux Toolkit, and React Query, using data from the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/). It demonstrates key modern React development practices including state management, API integration, dynamic UI updates, and routing. I learned how to use these advanced context for more effiecent state management througuout my React App and better handling API data with React Query. 

The Features of this app: 

- Product listing with title, image, description, price, category, and rating
- Dynamic product filtering by category (via dropdown)
- Shopping cart powered by Redux Toolkit
- Add/remove items to/from cart
- Total price and quantity calculation
- Cart state persisted using `sessionStorage`
- Simulated checkout functionality
- React Router with Home (`/`) and Cart (`/cart`) routes
- Navigation header with total cart items indicator
